            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Since her debut with her widely-acclaimed single "Ocean Eyes" in 2016, Billie Eilish has demonstrated great versatility and range within a soundscape that is still unmistakably her own. Throughout her career, Billie has released three albums: WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?, Happier Than Ever, and HIT ME HARD AND SOFT.</p>
            <p>Billie Eilish's debut album, WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?, released in 2019, introduced listeners to her unique blend of whispery vocals, dark pop melodies, and introspective lyrics. The album is characterized by its minimalist production, often featuring sparse beats and eerie sound effects, which create an intimate yet haunting atmosphere. Tracks like "bad guy" and "bury a friend" exemplify her innovative approach to pop music, blending genres and pushing the boundaries of mainstream sound.</p>
            <p>In 2021, Eilish released her second album, Happier Than Ever. This album marked a significant evolution in her sound, showcasing a more mature and refined musical style. While still maintaining her signature introspective and emotional lyricism, the production on this album is more polished and expansive. The album incorporates elements of jazz, classic rock, and even orchestral arrangements, as seen in tracks like "my future" and the title track "Happier Than Ever." This progression highlights Eilish's growth as an artist, both vocally and thematically, as she navigates personal and emotional complexities.</p>
            <p>Eilish's third album, HIT ME HARD AND SOFT, continues her evolution, blending the hushed singing style that distinguished her at her debut with the smoother flowing melodies she pivoted toward as her career continued. This album delves into the shifting emotional states of relationships and their many facets, seamlessly capturing complexity through ever-impressive lyricism. The production is lush and dynamic, featuring a mix of electronic beats, acoustic elements, and innovative soundscapes. Songs like "Soft Landing" and "Hard Impact" illustrate this duality, showcasing Eilish's ability to seamlessly transition between delicate, introspective moments and powerful, high-energy performances.</p>
